A PlatformIO project that implements a Larson scanner (LED chaser) effect in pure AVR assembly on an ATtiny88.

## üìñ Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a back-and-forth LED scanning effect, often called a Larson scanner or Cylon eye, using only AVR assembly language. The code directly manipulates the I/O registers of the ATtiny88 to control 5 LEDs connected to PORTB.

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware

*   **Microcontroller:** ATtiny88
*   **LEDs:** 5 LEDs connected to pins PB0 through PB4.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Software

*   **Platform:** Atmel AVR (via PlatformIO)
*   **Language:** AVR Assembly

## üöÄ How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2.  **Open with PlatformIO:**
    Open the `attiny88/ASM_ledchaser` folder in Visual Studio Code with the PlatformIO extension.
3.  **Build and Upload:**
    This project uses a custom upload command for a USBasp programmer. Make sure your `platformio.ini` is configured for your programmer.
    ```ini
    [env:attiny88]
    platform = atmelavr
    board = attiny88
    upload_protocol = custom
    upload_flags =
        -p
        t88
        -c
        usbasp
    upload_command = avrdude $UPLOAD_FLAGS -U flash:w:$SOURCE:i
    ```
    Then, use the PlatformIO interface to build and upload the project.
