A PlatformIO project demonstrating how to call assembly code from a C program on an ATtiny88.

## üìñ Overview

This project is a simple example of how to integrate AVR assembly code with a C program. The C code sets up the direction of a pin, and then calls an assembly routine in a loop. The assembly routine is responsible for blinking an LED connected to that pin.

This is a common technique for performance-critical tasks or when direct hardware manipulation is required.

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware

*   **Microcontroller:** ATtiny88
*   **LED:** A standard LED connected to pin PD0.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Software

*   **Platform:** Atmel AVR (via PlatformIO)
*   **Languages:** C and AVR Assembly

## üöÄ How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2.  **Open with PlatformIO:**
    Open the `attiny88/ASM_inC` folder in Visual Studio Code with the PlatformIO extension.
3.  **Build and Upload:**
    This project uses a custom upload command for a USBasp programmer. Make sure your `platformio.ini` is configured for your programmer.
    ```ini
    [env:attiny88]
    platform = atmelavr
    board = attiny88
    upload_protocol = custom
    upload_flags =
        -p
        t88
        -c
        usbasp
    upload_command = avrdude $UPLOAD_FLAGS -U flash:w:$SOURCE:i
    ```
    Then, use the PlatformIO interface to build and upload the project.
