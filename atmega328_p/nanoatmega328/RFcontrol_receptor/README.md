A PlatformIO project for receiving RF signals to control a 2-wheeled robot with an Arduino Nano.

## üìñ Overview

This project implements the receiver part of an RF remote control system. It's designed to receive signals from a corresponding transmitter, interpret them as motor commands, and drive a 2-wheeled robot using a TB6612 motor driver.

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware

*   **Microcontroller:** Arduino Nano (ATmega328)
*   **RF Module:** NRF24L01
*   **Motor Driver:** TB6612
*   **Motors:** 2 DC motors

## ‚öôÔ∏è Software

*   **Framework:** Arduino
*   **Platform:** Atmel AVR (via PlatformIO)
*   **Libraries:**
    *   `nrf24/RF24@^1.4.11`

## üöÄ How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2.  **Open with PlatformIO:**
    Open the `atmega328_p/nanoatmega328/RFcontrol_receptor` folder in Visual Studio Code with the PlatformIO extension.
3.  **Build and Upload:**
    Use the PlatformIO interface to build and upload the project to your Arduino Nano.

## üì° Communication

The receiver listens on the pipe address `0xE8E8F0F0E1LL`. Make sure your transmitter is sending data to this same address.

If no data is received for more than 1 second, the robot will stop as a safety measure.
